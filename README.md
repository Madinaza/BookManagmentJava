I originally built this after receiving feedback from a technical task where I struggled with Java fluency, missing libraries, and manual object handling. Instead of giving up, I used that as motivation to build this app from scratch â€” with a focus on the areas I was weakest in:

Proper file handling with ObjectMapper

Importing and managing Java collections

Practicing object creation, editing, and transformation

Improving code formatting and structure

Using IntelliJ IDEA efficiently (generation, structure, shortcuts)
